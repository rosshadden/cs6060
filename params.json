{"name":"cs6060","tagline":"cs6060 - Computer Graphics","body":"### Computer Graphics Assignments\r\nI have hosted the homework assignments online so that you can just hit them from a browser on any computer.  They are located [here](http://rosshadden.github.io/cs6060).  I am still sending you the files so you can see the code, but you can and should view the actual running webGL from this URL.  The reason is that when the page is viewed locally you can't load image files like the textures I am using--it needs to be hosted by a webserver.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 2\r\nThis can be found in the folder entitled \"2\".  Within is the shield that I showed during class, created with webGL.  The image may seem simple, but drawing the star was actually rather involved, and what you see is actually my 5th or 6th attempt at creating it.\r\n\r\n### Assignments 3-7\r\nThe rest of the homework assignments are all within the folder entitled \"room\", as that single folder contains the combined work from each of the individual assignments.\r\n\r\n#### Assignment 3\r\nqwer","google":"UA-22430916-7","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
